## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) - JS library
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I did

- Just built the component. It can be further optimized by extracting the Tag and the Avatar from it, but I decided that for this challenge it was enough to keep it all together.
- The storybook part was from a previous challenge and I just connected the new component to it.

### Continued development

- SASS

### Useful resources

- [CSS reset](https://piccalil.li/blog/a-more-modern-css-reset/) - Some CSS Reset recommendations to extend from by Andy Bell.
